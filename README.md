i created this project as a agk basic syntax reference.

somewhere i can go when i want to refresh my memory on how to use the language's basics.

like vars,ifs,arrays,loops etc.

its useful i you use other programming languages and mix up between syntax or need
a fast meme on how something works like "how do i loop an array?".

it will not teach you basic programming.

but if you programmed in a different language and want to learn agk syntax fast.
that's one way of doing that.
